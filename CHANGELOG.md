## v1.0.0
    - Released plasmidcanvas with support for:
        - Directional arrows and rectangles to represent features of a plasmid.
        - Support for restriction sites.
        - Support for arbitrary labels.
        - Support for overlapping features by automatically moving features inwards.
        - Support for base pair "ticks".
        - Two types of plasmid base pair tick labels:
            - auto - The circle is automatically labelled using the most suitable tick intervals.
            - n_labels - The circle is given n labels, evenly spaced around the plasmid circle.
        - Two types of feature labels:
            - off-circle - A label is placed outside the plasmid circle, pointing at the base pair / feature of interest.
            - on-circle (curved text) - A label is placed on a feature and curves around the circle with the feature.
        - Plasmids can be saved to a variety of filetypes e.g. png, pdf, ps, eps and svg.
