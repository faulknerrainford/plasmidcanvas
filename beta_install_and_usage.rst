plasmidcanvas 0.1.0 - Beta install and usage
============================================

If you are seeing this, thank you for deciding to take  a look at the beta version of plasmidcanvas!

This package is a work in progress Python graphics package designed for producing customised plasmid maps from scratch.

It would be massively appreciated if you could give me any feedback about this package as you use it.
This could be anything like:
* Problems with installing or using the package
* Issues with the generated plasmid maps
* Suggestions for features
* 

Prerequisites
=============
* Python 3.9 or higher is installed

Installation
============

1 - Open a command terminal (In windows, press 'windows key' + 'r' then enter 'cmd' to open one)
2 - Navigate to the plasmidcanvas folder from the zip (use cd path/to/the/folder)
3 - 

Current Features:
    * Two types of plasmid base pair tick labels
        * auto - The package finds the best 
        * n_labels - 

Upcoming Features:
    * More labelling styles - curved text, inside the circle labelling, multiple labels per feature
    * Base pair ticks
    * Extentions to the feature types e.g. allowing you to add Promoter instead of an ArrowFeature
    * Plasmid wide styling - i.e applying a style to all elements, sort of like a theme
    * Feature wide styling - i.e applying the same style to all of a type of feature
